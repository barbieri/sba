             SBA - Small Business Administration (Django)
             ============================================

A simple django website that helps managing a small business. I've
written it for my personal usage in a shoe store I owned -- do not
expect a generic system :-)

It contains:

 * dashboard with sales, cashflow and some nice charts
 * cashflow module:
   * balance
   * cost center
   * labels/tags
   * payments registry
 * sales module:
   * consumer registry
   * sales goal per sales person
   * non-sales registry
   * sales registry
   * products registry
 * suppliers module:
   * suppliers registry
   * suppliers payments registry
   * invoices registry
 * report module:
   * sales per sales person: daily, weekly and monthly
   * whole sales: daily, weekly and monthly
 * cashflow module:
   * highly configurable listing (balances, cost centers, payment types...)

Charts use Google Chart API.

I hope it may be of use for you, patches are accepted!
